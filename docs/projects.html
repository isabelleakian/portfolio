        <p class="bio2">For this case study, I worked in a group to redesign 
            the website for the Lake Erie Nature and Science Center in Bay Village, Ohio. 
            We went through the full UI design process, starting with creating user personas 
            and conducting interviews to better understand the customer needs, all the way 
            to high-fidelity prototyping for both mobile and desktop layouts in Figma.</p>
        <p class="bio2">We conducted interviews with key stakeholders from the Center to ensure we kept 
            their goals for the website redesign at the forefront of our design discussions, and 
            maintained communication throughout the process from low fidelity mockups to the final product.

        <p class="bio2">Above are our redesigned pages.
            We used a feature prioritization matrix to determine which areas of the site to focus on 
            for our high-fidelity mockup. Keeping in mind the insights we gained from stakeholders and users, 
            we focused our efforts on redesigning the site navigation, and revamping the animal information 
            pages and field trip planning pages. Click the button below to see our full presentation, with details 
            on the entire project lifecycle.
