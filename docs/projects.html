            <p class="biotabContent">For this case study, I worked in a group to redesign 
                the website for the Lake Erie Nature and Science Center in Bay Village, Ohio. 
                We went through the full UI design process, starting with creating user personas 
                and conducting interviews to better understand the customer needs, all the way 
                to high-fidelity prototyping for both mobile and desktop layouts in Figma.</p>
            <p class="biotabContent">We conducted interviews with key stakeholders from the Center to ensure we kept 
                their goals for the website redesign at the forefront of our design discussions, and 
                maintained communication throughout the process from low fidelity mockups to the final product.

            <p class="biotabContent">Above are our redesigned pages.
                We used a feature prioritization matrix to determine which areas of the site to focus on 
                for our high-fidelity mockup. Keeping in mind the insights we gained from stakeholders and users, 
                we focused our efforts on redesigning the site navigation, and revamping the animal information 
                pages and field trip planning pages. Click the button below to see our full presentation, with details

            <p class="biotab">UI/UX Design Challenge: WizTech - A Financial Literacy App for Young Adults</p>
            <p class="biotabContent">For this project, I worked in a group to create a high value educational app for 
                young adults looking to improve their financial literacy. We identified personal finance as a subject 
                area in which many young people feel undereducated, and while there are plenty of resources online, we 
                identified a gap in the market for a tool that presents complex financial topics in a way that is 
                approachable and simple yet still highly informative.
            </p>
            <p class="biotabContent">We created proto-personas to identify our potential user base and conducted numerous 
                interviews with young adults of various ages and with differing levels of financial literacy. We also held 
                interviews with professionals in the financial industry, to try and pinpoint some of the subject areas that 
                young adults feel they need the most guidance in. After analyzing our results using an affinity diagram and creating in-depth user 
                personas for our app, we decided to design a module-based educational tool, with topics such as budgeting, 
                credit, investing, and taxes. We also decided to incorporate a personal budgeting tool and financial goal tracker 
                in our app because we found that despite the plethora of options available on the internet and in the App Store, 
                no interviewee could provide an example of a budgeting tool that they truly enjoyed and saw value in. Our competitive 
                analysis confirmed these findings and further informed us on the gap for an interactive educational tool for personal finance.

                    This video is a walkthrough of our high-fidelity prototype of WizWealth desgined in Figma.
                    Throughout our design process we stayed true to our problem statement, which in short was: 
                    "How might we help young adults transitioning to adulthood facing new financial responsibilities without adequate guidance, 
                    ensuring that they are well-prepared for the future and equipped to navigate complex financial descisions?" This statement 
                    guided us through the entire UI/UX design process, from our user journey map, to our feature prioritization matrix, user 
                    flow diagrams, all the way to our low, mid, and high-fidelity prototypes. Click the button below to see our full presentation, with details
